      <h2>Part 1 -- The Readings and Videos, Question 1-6 Review</h2>

    <p> <b>Modularity:</b> Components of a system that can be arranged in a variety of configurations or roles ( very interchangeable)<br>
        <b>Decomposability:</b>The point at which elements cannot be broken down any further and doing so would just mean functional obliteration.  <br>
        If I take a crumb and cut it in half, I don't have two 1/2 crumbs. I now have 2 crumbs man.... -- George Carlin <br>
        <b>Emergence:</b> Emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own. These properties or behaviors emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. For example, smooth forward motion emerges when a bicycle and its rider interoperate, but neither part can produce the behavior on their own. <br>
        <b>Chaos Theory:</b>The behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and can have wide-ranging outcomes and still behave within larger systems that maintain balance. Also which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. </p> <br>

      <h3>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</h3>
      <p>--
      Answer: - A system which consists of a type of mapping network which must reach the requirements of being structured and organized. A working system can either be a group of people working together or a map of outlet malls for visitors and customers.  If the system is currently operational or functional, it is considered a “working” system. An example of what a working system is not, which is that it does not have or lacks details of how the supposed system operates.  Another example is for a group to be considered a system, it needs to consistently stay functional and serves a purpose.
      </p><br>
      <h3>Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Modular: </b>Multiple parts that fulfill a bigger purpose for an object. For instance,
        using a usb to save or import information to a laptop that saves space.<br>
        <b>Decomposability:</b> Studying parts separately such as parts of a car or laptop.<br>
        <b>Emergence:</b> The study of a subject in a group or whole rather than segregated or in parts such as bees, or flocks of birds.<br>
        <b>Chaos Theory:</b> what seems random is actually not; almost like an illusion, such as weather like rain or heat.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Q3 -- Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading. </h3>
      <p>Tessellation means a geometric shape is repeated over and over again, covering the plane of tiles without any gaps or overlaps. One example I found not in the reading might be the pattern of knitting and also kaleidoscope.</p><br>

      <h3>Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other? </h3>
      <p>Modularity can be replaced according to the actual displacement, without regularity. However, Tessellation cannot be replaced, because displacement will affect the overall regularity and visual effect. Substitutable and non-substitutable, irregular and regular</p><br>

      <h3>Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</h3>
      <p>Complexity is made up of things with different properties to achieve the same goal, being Uniform is things are built with the same properties to form a regular goal.</p><br>
