      <h3>Q1. What are the differences between site Specific art work and the idea of art interventions.</h3>
      <p>Site-specific art is art created to exist in a specific location. Often, artists think about location when planning and creating art. This kind of art will be integrated with the environment and connected with each other. Art intervention is an interaction with a pre-existing artwork, audience, place/space, or situation. It has the inspiration for concept art and is usually a form of performance art. In other words, art intervention is an existing art that affects the perception of the audience, the environment, and the current situation. Its existence is demonstrated using the existing site. They are the opposite of each other.</p>

      <h3>Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy? include your thoughts of on their idea of site specificness and interventions</h3>
      <p>I think the similarity between Walter Joseph De Maria and Banksy is that they both focus on the problems of the Earth and use space and time to create art. Walter Joseph De Maria's Lightning Field was built in a remote desert in New Mexico. He used nature to create art. He wants people to pay attention to the problems of nature and experience the different feelings that nature brings. It's an experience you can't have in a gallery. Banksy used streets’ walls to create art. He created art with humor and sarcasm to show social problems and expose the darkness of human nature. I think they both through art to arouse people's concern for things that were previously ignored. The difference is that Walter's art is created in a beautiful yearning. He hopes to change and attract people's attention to nature. Banksy, on the other hand, shows the pessimistic side of society and exposes the ugliness behind the beauty. Like Banksy's Dismaland, he shows the opposite of hypocrisy and depression in our reality. Both Walter and Banksy are concerned with the problems of the existing space and time, but they remind the audience from different directions.</p>
      <h3>Q3. What are some of the most common creative tactics that all the 'signs' must shares? What must sign have to remain relevant? We are talking about signs that both in the practical context as well as signs that function as art.</h3>
      <p>The most common creative strategy for all logos is visually striking, contrasting, bold fonts and text, and interesting content. What makes a logo relevant is its shape and color. Common symbols are displayed in polygonal shapes. Such as road signs. It makes people more receptive. And the color has to have a certain correlation. Yellow, for example, is a warning color.</p>

      <h3>Q4. What Kind of art, not shown here, have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description, provide images if possible.</h3>
