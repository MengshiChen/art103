      <h3>Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</h3>

      <p>We know from the podcast that what we now know about dinosaurs may not be true because what we now know about dinosaurs is that they are analyzed and made up of virtual visual effects from dinosaur bones. But as explained in the podcast, because dinosaurs were animals in nature, their skin and fat were broken down, so they probably had other features. The podcast talks about the idea that dinosaurs had humps, but because humps don't retain bones, we don't do a very good job of proving that. It seemed to me like a reversal of my previous understanding of dinosaurs. The dinosaurs I knew might not have been what I thought they were. They might have had a scarier, weirder look. It makes me wonder if archaeology can really give us the right knowledge or more knowledge? Maybe the previous technology is not advanced enough, but science and technology are developing, I believe that archaeology can bring us more relevant knowledge with better technology.</p>

      <h3>Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please eloborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.
      </h3>
      <p>Technology like this reminds me of the topic, "Could humans live on Mars?". John Conway's reasoning about dinosaurs makes sense, and he provides the evidences and analysis he has to prove it. But that's just Conway's theory of dinosaurs. Does it really exist? As we know from the data and satellite probes that Mars has signs of life, we can infer that Mars may be suitable for human survival, but is that the case? We have no way of knowing the truth. Perhaps future technological developments will make theory a reality?</p>

      <h3>Q3. First, summerize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Next given this article's shows examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past or current moment? </h3>
      <p>My understanding of material speculation is that material artefacts are designed to explore the connection between the real world and the non-real world. By making fictional objects, the real world forms a process of reference and discovers the existence and generation of facts from the fundamental virtual objects. How this article shows examples of possible future products, you can use this same technique to create objects that reference past or present moments. This reminds me of 3D Print. It may create a virtual object and turn it into a physical entity. 3D Print saves the current objects and provides reference for future research.</p>
